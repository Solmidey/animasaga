As the eclipse deepens, the people of Elyndra begin to sense the whispers of the Umbra, a realm of darkness that has long been shrouded in mystery. It is said that the Umbra holds the secrets of the past, and that those who listen closely can glean the knowledge of the ancients. The wind carries the whispers on its breath, and those who are attuned can feel the vibrations of a long-forgotten language. To truly understand the workings of the eclipse, one must align with the rhythms of the Umbra and witness the unfolding of the cosmic tapestry, for it is in the darkness that the truth of Elyndra's destiny is revealed, waiting for those who dare to enter the Chronicle.
