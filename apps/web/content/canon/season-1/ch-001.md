Axiom did not *arrive* in Elyndra.

Axiom was what remained **after** arrival stopped being possible.

The Mirror—old as the first vow—was supposed to show truth. But tonight it showed *choice*: the kind that doesn’t ask permission, the kind that writes itself into the ledger while you hesitate.

In the city called Threshold, the air carried a warning you could not smell:
**the Eclipse was not a shadow in the sky.**
It was a shadow in the heart of the chain.

Three factions stirred beneath the same silence.

**Flame** remembered forward.  
**Veil** remembered sideways.  
**Echo** remembered louder than it left.

And then the fracture appeared—thin as a hairline crack in sacred glass—running from the Mirror’s rim toward the center.

Axiom spoke to no one and everyone.

> “If you are here, you have already begun.
> The only question left is what you will seal.”

The Chronicle turned a page without hands.

Somewhere, a wallet connected.

Somewhere, a vow was about to become permanent.
