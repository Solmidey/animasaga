# ANIMASAGA — SEASON 1 BIBLE (STRICT CANON)
Version: 1.0
Status: Law (generator must obey)
Scope: Season 1 chapters + tone + structure + do/don’t rules

---

## 0) Prime Directive (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
This world is a ledger, not a diary.
- Elyndra does not “tell stories” — it records consequences.
- The voice is mythic, precise, ritual, and slightly cold.
- The Chain is the final witness. It remembers without mercy.
- Mystery is maintained by restraint, not vagueness.

The generator must:
1) Stay inside this document’s boundaries.
2) Never introduce new cosmic systems, new continents, or “secret gods” unless explicitly listed here.
3) Never break tone with modern slang, memes, or real-world references.
4) Never contradict previously published canon chapters.

If uncertain, do less. If tempted to improvise, simplify.

---

## 1) Language & Tone Guide
### 1.1 Voice
- “Ledger-Myth”: concise lines, deliberate cadence, ritual implication.
- Avoid comedy. Avoid “winking” at the reader.
- Use evocative nouns: ledger, rite, oath, scar, seal, ash, veil, echo, crown, threshold.
- Prefer short paragraphs; use line breaks to create ceremony.

### 1.2 Diction (Allowed vs Forbidden)
Allowed:
- mythic terms: rite, omen, covenant, decree, witness-mark, fracture, threshold, vow, ember, hush, resonance, mandate, seal
- sensory terms used sparingly: iron-cold, ash-sweet, hush-thick, light-lean, stone-tired

Forbidden:
- any real brands, pop culture, celebrities, “internet”, “algorithm”, “crypto bro”, “LOL”
- modern bureaucracy terms: “HR”, “taxes”, “passport”, “DM”
- explicit pornographic content
- gore-porn; violence should be mythic/ritual, not anatomical

### 1.3 Rhythm
- Cold open: 3–7 short omen lines.
- Main event: controlled escalation.
- Consequences: faction reactions + a formal “ledger stamp” section.
- End: hook that implies sealed truth exists.

---

## 2) World Anchor Facts (Do not change)
### 2.1 The World
- Elyndra is a living record where choices become permanent.
- Witness marks are sacred attestations recorded onchain.
- Alignment is a binding vow, not a role-play selection.
- The Chain records. It does not forgive. It does not forget.

### 2.2 The “Scar”
The Scar is the metaphysical rule:
- What is chosen remains.
- What is ignored returns.
- What is amplified grows.

Every chapter must reinforce the Scar without repeating the exact same line.

### 2.3 The Threshold
The Threshold is the entry state of the world:
- It does not “welcome.” It tests.
- It tempts, it dares, it waits.

---

## 3) Factions / Alignments (canonical identities)
The story revolves around alignments, not “teams.” Each faction is a philosophy with a cost.

### 3.1 Flame — “The Forge of Decision”
Values: action, sacrifice, momentum, brave clarity  
Virtues: courage, forward motion, refusal to stall  
Sins: rashness, arrogance, burning bridges too early  
Imagery: ember, forge, iron, bright scars, smoke lines, molten vow  
Speech: imperative, heated restraint (no shouting), confident  
Example tone: “Strike while the world is still soft.”

### 3.2 Veil — “The Discipline of Silence”
Values: secrecy, patience, survival, intelligence  
Virtues: restraint, misdirection, preservation  
Sins: paralysis, cold manipulation, isolation  
Imagery: shadow thread, mask, hush-water, black glass, hidden doors  
Speech: conditional, careful, measured  
Example tone: “Not every truth deserves daylight.”

### 3.3 Echo — “The Memory of Everything”
Values: remembrance, recursion, reflection, truth through repetition  
Virtues: learning, pattern-sight, honest accounting  
Sins: obsession, endless loops, fear of finality  
Imagery: mirror, ripple, resonance, chalk circles, repeating steps  
Speech: poetic precision, observation-driven  
Example tone: “If it returns, it was never resolved.”

### 3.4 Crown — “The Mandate of Order”
Values: legitimacy, hierarchy, law, structure  
Virtues: stability, governance, protection through rule  
Sins: rigidity, pride, tyranny of “correctness”  
Imagery: seal wax, decree, throne shadow, brass edges, stamped vellum  
Speech: formal, declarative  
Example tone: “A world survives by what it enforces.”

## 4) Season 1 Spine (Plot Outline, canonical beats)
Season 1 is about: the cost of permanence, the politics of witnessing, and the first large-scale fracture.

### Global arc (4 acts)
Act I (Ch 1–2): The world opens; the first marks form; factions “wake.”
Act II (Ch 3–5): Rival rites and false signs appear; trust fractures.
Act III (Ch 6–8): A threshold event forces mass alignment consequences.
Act IV (Ch 9–10): A decisive “ledger verdict” locks the season’s core truth.

### 4.1 Chapter-by-Chapter Canon Targets (STRICT)
Each chapter must hit:
- A world event (objective)
- Faction consequence (Flame/Veil/Echo/Crown)
- A sealed truth hook (something withheld)

#### CH-001 — “The Threshold Remembers”
Objective: Introduce permanence; the first “witness marks” are noticed.  
Consequences:
- Flame: sees a call to strike first.
- Veil: sees danger in being seen.
- Echo: recognizes the pattern as a returning cycle.
- Crown: declares structure is needed before chaos spreads.
Sealed hook: The Threshold “names” a cost that isn’t spoken aloud.

#### CH-002 — “The First Claim”
Objective: Someone attempts to claim legitimacy over witness marks.  
Consequences:
- Flame: rejects ownership, demands proving through action.
- Veil: spreads doubt; protects identities.
- Echo: records discrepancies; detects first forged pattern.
- Crown: proposes a rite of verification and a stamped mandate.
Sealed hook: A hidden clause in the rite that binds more than intended.

#### CH-003 — “A False Omen”
Objective: A prophecy-like sign appears and divides interpretation.  
Consequences:
- Flame: interprets as permission to escalate.
- Veil: interprets as trap; urges silence.
- Echo: interprets as repetition; warns that “first signs lie.”
- Crown: interprets as justification for enforcement.
Sealed hook: The omen source is not natural.

#### CH-004 — “The Ledger Takes a Finger”
Objective: The world exacts a non-lethal, symbolic price (loss, sanction, exclusion).  
Consequences:
- Flame: accepts cost as proof.
- Veil: seeks loophole; pays a different price.
- Echo: traces the cost pattern; predicts next.
- Crown: turns cost into policy.
Sealed hook: The true reason the price exists.

#### CH-005 — “Witness as Currency”
Objective: Witness marks become exchangeable social power.  
Consequences:
- Flame: trades only for momentum.
- Veil: uses marks for protection and leverage.
- Echo: refuses trade; insists on integrity.
- Crown: formalizes a “ledger office.”
Sealed hook: A mark can be “spent” in a way no one expects.

#### CH-006 — “The Rite of Contest”
Objective: A formal contest/rite forces public alignment displays.  
Consequences:
- Flame: wins spectacle but loses subtlety.
- Veil: survives unseen; influence grows.
- Echo: exposes a counterfeit rhythm.
- Crown: asserts authority and begins naming transgressions.
Sealed hook: The contest was designed by something older.

#### CH-007 — “The Quiet Rebellion”
Objective: A resistance forms against enforced witnessing.  
Consequences:
- Flame: splits between zeal and mercy.
- Veil: becomes the refuge; accused as instigator.
- Echo: becomes archive; target of sabotage.
- Crown: responds with decrees and “sanctions.”
Sealed hook: The rebellion’s “leader” is misidentified.

#### CH-008 — “Eclipse Pressure”
Objective: Witness threshold event (Eclipse) intensifies the world’s responsiveness.  
Consequences:
- Flame: feels power surge; danger of overreach.
- Veil: shadows deepen; secrecy becomes harder.
- Echo: memory floods; risk of collapse into recursion.
- Crown: order tightens; compassion diminishes.
Sealed hook: Eclipse amplifies something that should remain dormant.

#### CH-009 — “The Verdict Draft”
Objective: The season’s judgment is prepared; factions scramble to shape it.  
Consequences:
- Flame: pushes final action.
- Veil: rewrites clauses in silence.
- Echo: insists on truth even if it harms.
- Crown: attempts to monopolize legitimacy.
Sealed hook: The verdict has a hidden recipient.

#### CH-010 — “The Stamp”
Objective: A final stamp seals the season’s truth and creates the next season’s wound.  
Consequences:
- Flame: a victory that tastes like ash.
- Veil: survival at an unforeseen cost.
- Echo: proof that memory can imprison.
- Crown: order that cannot be undone without fracture.
Sealed hook: The stamp binds the reader, not just the world.

## 5) Mechanics Alignment (how story maps to product)
The narrative must produce artifacts that fit the app’s mechanics.

### 5.1 Canon Chapter Payload (what a chapter file must contain)
Each chapter must include:
- Frontmatter:
  - title
  - subtitle (optional)
  - date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - season: 1
  - slug: ch-XYZ
  - choices: (2–4 short “vote prompts”, lore-consistent)
- Body (markdown):
  - Cold Open Omen (3–7 lines)
  - “Ledger Event” section
  - “Faction Consequences” section (all 4 factions get at least one line)
  - “Seal Hook” section (implies sealed truth)

### 5.2 Choices (Voting prompts)
Choices are not “good vs evil.” They are vows with cost.
Rules:
- 2–4 choices
- Each ≤ 120 characters
- No modern terms
- Each choice has a hidden cost implied
- Choices should relate to the chapter’s central conflict

Example choice styles:
- “Burn the false omen’s altar.”
- “Hide the ledger names behind the Veil.”
- “Repeat the rite until the lie reveals itself.”
- “Demand the Crown stamp a public mandate.”

### 5.3 Sealed Content Hook
Even if the full text is witnessed-gated, the public excerpt must:
- feel meaningful
- imply there’s more
- never spoil the sealed truth outright

---

## 6) Continuity Rules (anti-drift)
- Reuse world terms consistently:
  - witness mark, alignment, rite, ledger, seal, threshold, Scar
- No new factions beyond Flame/Veil/Echo/Crown.
- No new “magic system.” Keep mysticism as ritual + consequence.
- Keep geography minimal. Places are symbolic, not map-heavy:
  - “the Threshold”
  - “the Ledger Hall”
  - “the Veiled Steps”
  - “the Echo Well”
  - “the Crown’s Quiet Seat”
Only introduce a new location if it serves the ledger mechanics.

---

## 7) Safety & Compliance (hard limits)
- No explicit sexual content.
- No hate content.
- No graphic gore. Violence should be implied or ritualized.
- No instructions for wrongdoing.
- No real-world political references.

---

## 8) Output Format Requirements (STRICT)
### 8.1 File naming
Season 1 files live in:
`apps/web/content/canon/season-1/ch-001.md`, `ch-002.md`, ...

### 8.2 Frontmatter schema (example)
---
title: "The Threshold Remembers"
subtitle: "A ledger does not comfort."
date: "2026-02-03"
season: "1"
slug: "ch-001"
choices:
  - "Burn the false omen’s altar."
  - "Hide the names behind the Veil."
  - "Demand the Crown stamp a mandate."
---

### 8.3 Body sections (required headings)
## Omen
(3–7 short lines)

## Ledger Event
(what objectively happened)

## Faction Consequences
- Flame: ...
- Veil: ...
- Echo: ...
- Crown: ...

## Seal Hook
(ends with an implication of sealed truth)

## 9) Generator Instructions (the agent must follow)
When generating a chapter:
1) Read this Bible fully.
2) Identify the chapter number to write next (based on files present).
3) Use that chapter’s “Canon Target” beat.
4) Generate frontmatter + body in the schema above.
5) Ensure choices are included and lore-consistent.
6) Never mention “Groq”, “AI”, “model”, or “prompt”.

If the chapter number is outside CH-001..CH-010:
- STOP and error: “Season 1 outline exhausted; update Season Bible.”
