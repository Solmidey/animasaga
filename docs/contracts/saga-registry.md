# SagaRegistry Invariants

SagaRegistry is the source of truth.

## Invariants

- A wallet may hold only one faction per Season
- Faction choice is immutable until Season rollover
- Ilios cannot be user-assigned
- History is never deleted
- Registry never interprets meaning

SagaRegistry records state.
Nothing more.
