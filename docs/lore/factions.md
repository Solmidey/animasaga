# Factions of Elyndra

Factions are not teams.
They are long-term consequences.

## Bearer of Flame
Principle: Action before certainty  
Power: Momentum, initiation  
Risk: Recklessness

## Bearer of Veil
Principle: Information asymmetry  
Power: Concealment, delayed revelation  
Risk: Isolation

## Bearer of Echo
Principle: Amplification  
Power: Influence multiplication  
Risk: Abuse through noise

Echo amplification only applies when:
- Minimum quorum is met
- The originating signal is not from an Echo bearer

## Bearer of Crown
Principle: Authority  
Power: Binding decisions  
Risk: Tyranny

## Ilios (Dormant / Extremely Rare)
Principle: Persistence  
Constraint:
- Cannot be chosen directly
- Emerges only through long-term onchain conditions

Ilios is not power.
Ilios is continuity.
