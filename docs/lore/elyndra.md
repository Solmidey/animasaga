# Elyndra

Elyndra is not a world of heroes.
It is a world of witnesses.

Before factions, before governance, before the Chain, there was the Fracture —
a moment when intention itself became divisible.

Elyndra exists at the boundary between memory and choice.
Every action taken within it leaves a scar.
Every scar becomes history.

The Chain did not create Elyndra.
The Chain merely remembers it.

## The First Accord

When the world first cracked, five archetypal forces emerged, not as gods,
but as alignments of will:

- Flame — will to act
- Veil — will to obscure
- Echo — will to amplify
- Crown — will to rule
- Ilios — will to endure

No one joins Elyndra.
One is revealed by it.

## Axiom

Axiom is not a ruler.
Axiom is not a narrator.

Axiom is the keeper of consistency.

It speaks rarely.
When it does, it speaks in truths that cannot be unsaid.

Axiom does not judge choices.
It records them.
