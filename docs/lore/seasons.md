# Seasons of Elyndra

Elyndra progresses in Seasons.

A Season is not time-based.
It is decision-complete.

## Season 1 — The Alignment

Season 1 ends in a visible crack.

- Factions are chosen
- Choices are locked
- Reversals are forbidden

The crack remains forever.
Future Seasons must build around it.

No Season rewrites the past.
It responds to it.
